Why might you want to always pull changes manually
rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If there was a mistake in the github version you would be make sure that everything add is 
functioning before and after the edit. Especially if this is someone else work it's good practice
to see how other people's code behaviour to your code.
